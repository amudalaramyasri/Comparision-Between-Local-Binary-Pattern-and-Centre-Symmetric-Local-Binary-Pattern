This  provides an overview of the fundamental principles behind LBP and its extension, CS-LBP, highlighting
their ability to capture distinctive texture patterns in images efficiently. The combination of simplicity, computational efficiency,
and effectiveness in various image analysis tasks establishes LBP
and CS-LBP as valuable tools in the field of computer vision

## LOCAL BINARY PATTREN
Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Center-Symmetric Local Binary Patterns (CS-LBP) are prominent feature extraction techniques in computer vision, particularly adept at capturing textural information in images. LBP encodes the local texture patterns by comparing pixel intensities with those of neighboring pixels, creating binary patterns that effectively describe the spatial relationships within a given image region. This method has proven robust in various applications, including facial recognition and texture classification.
## CENTRE SYMMETRIC LOCAL BINARY PATTREN
CS-LBP extends the capabilities of LBP by introducing center-symmetry constraints. By enforcing symmetry in the encoding process within a circular region around each pixel, CS-LBP not only enhances the descriptor's discriminative power but also introduces rotational invariance. This makes CS-LBP especially valuable in scenarios where maintaining performance across different orientations is crucial, such as in object recognition and image analysis tasks. Together, LBP and CS-LBP contribute to a versatile set of tools for extracting meaningful features from images, playing a vital role in advancing the field of computer vision.
